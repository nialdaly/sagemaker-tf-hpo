## Model Hyperparameter Optimization with SageMaker & TensorFlow
This project covers model hyperparameter optimization (tuning) across a number of different deep learning problems/datasets using TensorFlow and Amazon SageMaker.

A `conda_tensorflow2_p36` kernel was used with the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance.
